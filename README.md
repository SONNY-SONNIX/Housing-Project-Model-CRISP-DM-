Housing Project Model using  CRISP-DM 

STEPS
--------
1. Import libraies(Numpy,Matplotlib,Pandas,Seaborn).

2.Load the dataset for the project to jupyter notebook.

3.The info() method is useful to get a quick description of the data, in particular the total number of rows, and each attribute’s type and number of non-null values:

4.Finds the count of districts that belong to each category|| value_counts() methods

5.Let’s look at the other fields. The describe() method shows a summary of the numerical attributes

6.a percentile indicates the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations falls

7.Explore and visualize the data to gain insights

8.Setting the alpha option to 0.1 makes it much easier to visualize the places where there is a high density of data points
